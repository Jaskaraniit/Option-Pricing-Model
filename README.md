Option Pricing on USD/CNY
Project Overview
This project focuses on pricing options for the USD/CNY currency pair using quantitative models implemented in Python. It involves financial data analysis, option pricing models, and visualization.
Files
 Option_Pricing_USD_CNY_Jaskaran.ipynb
â€¢	A Jupyter notebook that:
	Loads and processes historical USD/CNY exchange rate data.
	Implements option pricing models (likely Black-Scholes, Binomial, Monte Carlo, or others).
	Calculates option prices based on market data.
	Includes visualization of data trends and model outputs.
2. USDCNY.csv
	Contains historical exchange rate data for USD/CNY.
	This dataset is used as input for the option pricing models in the notebook.
Features
	Data cleaning and preprocessing.
	Volatility estimation.
	Implementation of option pricing models.
	Visualization of exchange rate trends and option pricing results.
	Sensitivity analysis on model parameters (optional depending on implementation).
Requirements
	Python 3.x
	Libraries used (you can install via pip install):
	numpy
	pandas
	matplotlib
	scipy
	yfinance (if live data retrieval is included)
	mplfinance (if candlestick plots are used)
	jupyter (for running the notebook)
How to Run
1.	Install the required libraries.
2.	Open the notebook Option_Pricing_USD_CNY_Jaskaran.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3.	Make sure the USDCNY.csv file is in the same directory as the notebook.
4.	Run all cells to process the data and view results.
Applications
	Understanding how exchange rate options are priced.
	Exploring model behavior for emerging market currency pairs like USD/CNY.
	Educational use for financial modeling and quantitative finance students.
